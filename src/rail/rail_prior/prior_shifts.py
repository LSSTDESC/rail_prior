    Projector for the shifts model.
    The shift model assumes that all the variation in the measured
    photometric distributions can be described by a single shift in
    the position of the mean of a fiducial n(z) distribution.

    This shift is calibrated by computing the standard deviations
    of the measured photometric distributions over redshift.
    The shift prior is then given by a Gaussian distribution with
    mean 0 and variance equal to the ratio of the standard deviation
    of the standard deviations to the mean of the standard deviations.
